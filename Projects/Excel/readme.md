Conclusion

In this Excel project, I worked on raw sales data and converted it into a meaningful dashboard using Excel features like formulas, 
pivot tables, and charts. 
The dashboard clearly shows sales performance, target achievement, and region-wise trends, which makes the data easy to understand at a glance.
This project helped me improve my skills in data cleaning, calculations, and data visualization using Excel. 
It also shows my ability to analyze raw data and present insights in a clear and structured way that can support business decision-making.
