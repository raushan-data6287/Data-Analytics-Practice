## Conclusion
This SQL project demonstrates the use of structured queries to analyze airport passenger
data effectively. Through the use of aggregations, filtering, grouping, and advanced SQL
concepts such as CTEs, the analysis provides meaningful insights into passenger trends and
city-wise performance. The project reflects my ability to work with real-world datasets,
write optimized SQL queries, and derive data-driven insights.
