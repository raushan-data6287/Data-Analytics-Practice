A PDF version of the Power BI dashboard is uploaded in this folder for easy viewing.

The complete Power BI (.pbix) file is large in size and cannot be uploaded directly to GitHub.

## Conclusion
In this project, I used the same airport dataset to build an interactive Power BI dashboard.
I focused on showing passenger trends, airport locations, and overall airline performance
using clear visuals like maps, charts, and KPIs. Slicers are applied to the entire report
so users can easily filter the data, while buttons are used to switch between origin and
destination views in selected visuals. This project helped me understand how to turn data
analysis into simple and meaningful dashboards.
